## How to run

flutter run -d chrome --web-port=7357
```
You can add and change authorized ports over here:

## Changing between development and production runs
The firebase database is split into two parent nodes 
**```production-organization```** and **```development-organization```**

You can change which one the program uses in the ```main.dart``` file

This is so that you can develop the application while not having to interfere with people using the application at the same time.
